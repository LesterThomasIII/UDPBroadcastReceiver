# UDPBroadcastReceiver
its an Ugly baby but this baby still works
this intial concept is designed to read data that is coming from anywhere UDP if you have the network capability. 
Nothing elaborate, it is a simple console App that works with C#. 
several TODO's still to go
~~~1. set what port you want to listen on~~~ completed
~~~2. fix it so you can get the IP Address from the remote sender if they provide it.~~~ Completed with ECHO Command attached, Sender must initiate the ECHO Command
